Queue sysfs files
=================

This text file will detail the queue files that are located in the sysfs tree
for each block device. Note that stacked devices typically do not export
any settings, since their queue merely functions are a remapping target.
These files are the ones found in the /sys/block/xxx/queue/ directory.

Files denoted with a RO postfix are readonly and the RW postfix means
read-write.

hw_sector_size (RO)
-------------------
This is the hardware sector size of the device, in bytes.

max_hw_sectors_kb (RO)
----------------------
This is the maximum number of kilobytes supported in a single data transfer.

max_sectors_kb (RW)
-------------------
This is the maximum number of kilobytes that the block layer will allow
for a filesystem request. Must be smaller than or equal to the maximum
size allowed by the hardware.

nomerges (RW)
-------------
This enables the user to disable the lookup logic involved with IO merging
requests in the block layer. Merging may still occur through a direct
1-hit cache, since that comes for (almost) free. The IO scheduler will not
waste cycles doing tree/hash lookups for merges if nomerges is 1. Defaults
to 0, enabling all merges.

nr_requests (RW)
----------------
This controls how many requests may be allocated in the block layer for
read or write requests. Note that the total allocated number may be twice
this amount, since it applies only to reads or writes (not the accumulated
sum).

read_ahead_kb (RW)
------------------
Maximum number of kilobytes to read-ahead for filesystems on this block
device.

rq_affinity (RW)
----------------
If this option is enabled, the block layer will migrate request completions
to the CPU that originally submitted the request. For some workloads
this provides a significant reduction in CPU cycles due to caching effects.

scheduler (RW)
--------------
When read, this file will display the current and available IO schedulers
for this block device. The currently active IO scheduler will be enclosed
in [] brackets. Writing an IO scheduler name to this file will switch
control of this block device to that new IO scheduler. Note that writing
an IO scheduler name to this file will attempt to load that IO scheduler
module, if it isn't already present in the system.
