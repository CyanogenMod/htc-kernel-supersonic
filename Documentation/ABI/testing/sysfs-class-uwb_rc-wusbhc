Description:
                Write the CHID (16 space-separated hex octets) for this host controller.
                This starts the host controller, allowing it to accept connection from
                WUSB devices.

                Set an all zero CHID to stop the host controller.

Description:
                Devices that haven't sent a WUSB packet to the host
                within 'wusb_trust_timeout' ms are considered to have
                disconnected and are removed.  The default value of
                4000 ms is the value required by the WUSB
                specification.

                Since this relates to security (specifically, the
                lifetime of PTKs and GTKs) it should not be changed
                from the default.
