config PCI
	bool "PCI support"
	depends on SYS_SUPPORTS_PCI
	help
	  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
	  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
	  your box. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

config SH_PCIDMA_NONCOHERENT
	bool "Cache and PCI noncoherent"
	depends on PCI
	default y
	help
	  Enable this option if your platform does not have a CPU cache which
	  remains coherent with PCI DMA. It is safest to say 'Y', although you
	  will see better performance if you can say 'N', because the PCI DMA
	  code will not have to flush the CPU's caches. If you have a PCI host
	  bridge integrated with your SH CPU, refer carefully to the chip specs
	  to see if you can say 'N' here. Otherwise, leave it as 'Y'.
