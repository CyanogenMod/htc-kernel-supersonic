	help
	  Say Y here if you want to compile in powerdomain layer
	  debugging messages for OMAP2/3.   These messages can
	  provide more detail as to why some powerdomain calls
	  may be failing, and will also emit a descriptive message
	  for every powerdomain register write.  However, the
	  extra detail costs some memory.

config OMAP_DEBUG_CLOCKDOMAIN
	bool "Emit debug messages from clockdomain layer"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2 || ARCH_OMAP3
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to compile in clockdomain layer
	  debugging messages for OMAP2/3.   These messages can

config OMAP_RESET_CLOCKS

	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	help
	  Say Y if you want to reset unused clocks during boot.
	  This option saves power, but assumes all drivers are
	  using the clock framework. Broken drivers that do not
	  yet use clock framework may not work with this option.
	  If you are booting from another operating system, you
	  probably do not want this option enabled until your
	  device drivers work properly.

	default y
        help
          Pin multiplexing support for OMAP boards. If your bootloader
          sets the multiplexing correctly, say N. Otherwise, or if unsure,
          say Y.

config OMAP_MUX_DEBUG
	bool "Multiplexing debug output"
        depends on OMAP_MUX
        help
          Makes the multiplexing functions print out a lot of debug info.
          This is useful if you want to find out the correct values of the
          multiplexing registers.

config OMAP_MUX_WARNINGS

        depends on OMAP_MUX
        default y
        help
	  Choose Y here to warn whenever driver initialization logic needs
	  to change the pin multiplexing setup.  When there are no warnings
	  printed, it's safe to deselect OMAP_MUX for your product.

config OMAP_MCBSP

	  Select this option if you want to enable the OMAP 32KHz timer.
	  This timer saves power compared to the OMAP_MPU_TIMER, and has
	  support for no tick during idle. The 32KHz timer provides less
	  intra-tick resolution than OMAP_MPU_TIMER. The 32KHz timer is
	  currently only available for OMAP16XX, 24XX, 34XX and OMAP4.
