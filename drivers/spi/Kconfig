menuconfig SPI
	bool "SPI support"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  The "Serial Peripheral Interface" is a low level synchronous
	  protocol.  Chips that support SPI can have data transfer rates
	  up to several tens of Mbit/sec.  Chips are addressed with a
	  controller and a chipselect.  Most SPI slaves don't support
	  dynamic device discovery; some are even write-only or read-only.

	  SPI is widely used by microcontrollers to talk with sensors,
	  eeprom and flash memory, codecs and various other controller
	  chips, analog to digital (and d-to-a) converters, and more.
	  MMC and SD cards can be accessed using SPI protocol; and for
	  DataFlash cards used in MMC sockets, SPI must always be used.

	  SPI is one of a family of similar protocols using a four wire
	  interface (select, clock, data in, data out) including Microwire
	  (half duplex), SSP, SSI, and PSP.  This driver framework should
	  work with most such devices and controllers.

config SPI_ATMEL

	tristate "Au1550/Au12x0 SPI Controller"
	depends on (SOC_AU1550 || SOC_AU1200) && EXPERIMENTAL
	select SPI_BITBANG
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Au1550 SPI controller (may also work with Au1200,Au1210,Au1250).

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called au1550_spi.

config SPI_BITBANG
	tristate "Utilities for Bitbanging SPI masters"
	help
	  With a few GPIO pins, your system can bitbang the SPI protocol.
	  Select this to get SPI support through I/O pins (GPIO, parallel
	  port, etc).  Or, some systems' SPI master controller drivers use
	  this code to manage the per-word or per-transfer accesses to the
	  hardware shift registers.

	  This is library code, and is automatically selected by drivers that
	  need it.  You only need to select this explicitly to support driver
	  modules that aren't part of this kernel tree.

config SPI_BUTTERFLY
	tristate "Parallel port adapter for AVR Butterfly (DEVELOPMENT)"

	help
	  This uses a custom parallel port cable to connect to an AVR
	  Butterfly <http://www.atmel.com/products/avr/butterfly>, an
	  inexpensive battery powered microcontroller evaluation board.
	  This same cable can be used to flash new firmware.

config SPI_GPIO
	tristate "GPIO-based bitbanging SPI Master"
	depends on GENERIC_GPIO
	select SPI_BITBANG
	help
	  This simple GPIO bitbanging SPI master uses the arch-neutral GPIO
	  interface to manage MOSI, MISO, SCK, and chipselect signals.  SPI
	  slaves connected to a bus using this driver are configured as usual,
	  except that the spi_board_info.controller_data holds the GPIO number
	  for the chipselect used by this controller driver.

	  Note that this driver often won't achieve even 1 Mbit/sec speeds,
	  making it unusually slow for SPI.  If your platform can inline
	  GPIO operations, you should be able to leverage that for better
	  speed with a custom version of this driver; see the source code.
