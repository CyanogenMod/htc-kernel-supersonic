	  This section contains all the pre 802.11 and 802.11 wireless
	  device drivers. For a complete list of drivers and documentation
	  on them refer to the wireless wiki:

menuconfig WLAN_PRE80211
	bool "Wireless LAN (pre-802.11)"
	depends on NETDEVICES
	---help---
	  Say Y if you have any pre-802.11 wireless LAN hardware.

	  This option does not affect the kernel build, it only
	  lets you choose drivers.

config STRIP
	tristate "STRIP (Metricom starmode radio IP)"
	depends on INET && WLAN_PRE80211
	select WIRELESS_EXT
	---help---
	  Say Y if you have a Metricom radio and intend to use Starmode Radio
	  IP. STRIP is a radio protocol developed for the MosquitoNet project
	  to send Internet traffic using Metricom radios.  Metricom radios are
	  small, battery powered, 100kbit/sec packet radio transceivers, about
	  the size and weight of a cellular telephone. (You may also have heard
	  them called "Metricom modems" but we avoid the term "modem" because
	  it misleads many people into thinking that you can plug a Metricom
	  modem into a phone line and use it as a modem.)

	  You can use STRIP on any Linux machine with a serial port, although
	  it is obviously most useful for people with laptop computers. If you
	  think you might get a Metricom radio in the future, there is no harm
	  in saying Y to STRIP now, except that it makes the kernel a bit
	  bigger.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called strip.

config ARLAN
	tristate "Aironet Arlan 655 & IC2200 DS support"
	depends on ISA && !64BIT && WLAN_PRE80211
	select WIRELESS_EXT
	---help---
	  Aironet makes Arlan, a class of wireless LAN adapters. These use the
	  www.Telxon.com chip, which is also used on several similar cards.
	  This driver is tested on the 655 and IC2200 series cards. Look at
	  <http://www.ylenurme.ee/~elmer/655/> for the latest information.

	  The driver is built as two modules, arlan and arlan-proc. The latter
	  is the /proc interface and is not needed most of time.

	  On some computers the card ends up in non-valid state after some
	  time. Use a ping-reset script to clear it.

config WAVELAN
	tristate "AT&T/Lucent old WaveLAN & DEC RoamAbout DS ISA support"
	depends on ISA && WLAN_PRE80211
	select WIRELESS_EXT
	---help---
	  The Lucent WaveLAN (formerly NCR and AT&T; or DEC RoamAbout DS) is
	  a Radio LAN (wireless Ethernet-like Local Area Network) using the
	  radio frequencies 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz.

	  If you want to use an ISA WaveLAN card under Linux, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. Some more specific
	  information is contained in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/wavelan.txt> and in the source code
	  <file:drivers/net/wireless/wavelan.p.h>.

	  You will also need the wireless tools package available from
	  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.
	  Please read the man pages contained therein.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be

	  (PC-card) wireless Ethernet networking card to your computer.  This
	  driver is for the non-IEEE-802.11 Wavelan cards.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
