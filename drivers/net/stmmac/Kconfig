	  Selecting this option, rx has priority over Tx (only for Giga
	  Ethernet device).
	  By default, the DMA arbitration scheme is based on Round-robin
	  (rx:tx priority is 1:1).

	  Some ST SoCs (for example the stx7141 and stx7200c2) have two
	  Ethernet Controllers. This option turns on the second Ethernet
	  device on this kind of platforms.
