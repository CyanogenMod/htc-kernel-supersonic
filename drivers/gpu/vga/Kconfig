	  Some "legacy" VGA devices implemented on PCI typically have the same
	  hard-decoded addresses as they did on ISA. When multiple PCI devices
	  are accessed at same time they need some kind of coordination. Please
	  see Documentation/vgaarbiter.txt for more details. Select this to
	  enable VGA arbiter.
