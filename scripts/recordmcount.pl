# recordmcount.pl - makes a section called __mcount_loc that holds
#                   all the offsets to the calls to mcount.
#
#
# What we want to end up with is a section in vmlinux called
# __mcount_loc that contains a list of pointers to all the
# call sites in the kernel that call mcount. Later on boot up, the kernel
# will read this list, save the locations and turn them into nops.
# When tracing or profiling is later enabled, these locations will then
# be converted back to pointers to some function.
#
# This is no easy feat. This script is called just after the original
# object is compiled and before it is linked.
#
# The references to the call sites are offsets from the section of text
# that the call site is in. Hence, all functions in a section that
# has a call site to mcount, will have the offset from the beginning of
# the section and not the beginning of the function.
#
# The trick is to find a way to record the beginning of the section.
# The way we do this is to look at the first function in the section
# which will also be the location of that section after final link.
# e.g.
#
#  .section ".sched.text", "ax"
#  .globl my_func
#  my_func:
#        [...]
#        call mcount  (offset: 0x5)
#        [...]
#        ret
#  other_func:
#        [...]
#        call mcount (offset: 0x1b)
#        [...]
#
# Both relocation offsets for the mcounts in the above example will be
# offset from .sched.text. If we make another file called tmp.s with:
#
#  .section __mcount_loc
#  .quad  my_func + 0x5
#  .quad  my_func + 0x1b
#
# We can then compile this tmp.s into tmp.o, and link it to the original
# object.
#
# But this gets hard if my_func is not globl (a static function).
# In such a case we have:
#
#  .section ".sched.text", "ax"
#  my_func:
#        [...]
#        call mcount  (offset: 0x5)
#        [...]
#        ret
#  other_func:
#        [...]
#        call mcount (offset: 0x1b)
#        [...]
#
# If we make the tmp.s the same as above, when we link together with
# the original object, we will end up with two symbols for my_func:
# one local, one global.  After final compile, we will end up with
# an undefined reference to my_func.
#
# Since local objects can reference local variables, we need to find
# a way to make tmp.o reference the local objects of the original object
# file after it is linked together. To do this, we convert the my_func
# into a global symbol before linking tmp.o. Then after we link tmp.o
# we will only have a single symbol for my_func that is global.
# We can convert my_func back into a local symbol and we are done.
#
# Here are the steps we take:
#
# 1) Record all the local symbols by using 'nm'
# 2) Use objdump to find all the call site offsets and sections for
#    mcount.
# 3) Compile the list into its own object.
# 4) Do we have to deal with local functions? If not, go to step 8.
# 5) Make an object that converts these local functions to global symbols
#    with objcopy.
# 6) Link together this new object with the list object.
# 7) Convert the local functions back to local symbols and rename
#    the result as the original object.
#    End.
# 8) Link the object with the list object.
# 9) Move the result back to the original object.
#    End.
